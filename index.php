            My name is Josh Whitkin. I'm a professional with more than 7 years industry experience in Games Design,
            Level design, scripting and visual effects. What makes me passionate about games is the combination of technology and creativity
            and how multiple disciplines come ogether to create an interactive experience. Whether I'm designing for puzzle games, 2D platformers or
            3D environments. I always tell a story.
